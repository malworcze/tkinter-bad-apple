# Bad Apple!! Tkinter in real time and with Audio support
This is a stupid little program that I made because I was bored

## How can I run this program?
### Note: MAKE SURE TO INSTALL PYTHON TO PATH, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!!


Download the source-code [here]()

This program was coded in Python 3.11.x because I used PyGame for the real-time audio support but If you want to use the newest python you can use it too, There is some modules that I use to make this possible, you may install it with the command below using pip
```
pip install opencv-python pygame-ce pillow numpy
```

and then run the ``script.py`` file


## Showcase
